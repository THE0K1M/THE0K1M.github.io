Hello, This is Theodore Kim.
I am a current PhD student in Jones School of Business, Rice University.
My research interest revolves around Entrepreneurs (pre-fund stage).
What kind of obstacles they are facing? How do they overcome their difficulties.
Research context is usually racial or social minorities in United States. From minority standing point, their obstacles usually are blamed as own fault (language, lack of human capital, education-level, lack of social skill).
But I have seen that entrepreneurs are still facing difficulties despite of high education, or second-generation.
What kind of ecological, social, or enviornmental factors still affect their entrepreneurship?
