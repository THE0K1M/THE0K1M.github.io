<!----

Research context is usually racial or social minorities in United States. From minority standing point, their obstacles usually are blamed as own fault (language, lack of human capital, education-level, lack of social skill).
But I have seen that entrepreneurs are still facing difficulties despite of high education, or second-generation.
What kind of ecological, social, or enviornmental factors still affect their entrepreneurship?
